# scripts

This is just some script or bash history in some cases for installation of software. these software are not mine,
and the installation are all done in labs, later used in productions so all informations in these scripts if there are any is LAB data

feel free to use these scripts if there is anything useful for you, I would recommend to look through the script before running it, some scripts have promts for input.
other don't have, and there might be some variables that you should change for security reasons, such as password, etc.
